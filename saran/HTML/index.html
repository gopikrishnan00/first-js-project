  <p style="color:green;font-size:25px;text-align:center;font-family:arial;">A group of verse lines that make up a single rhetorical unit. In longer poems, the first line is often indented, like a paragraph in prose. The long narrative passages of John Milton’s Paradise Lost are verse paragraphs. The titled sections of <br>Robert Pinsky’s “Essay on Psychiatrists” demarcate shifts in focus and argument much as prose paragraphs would. A shorter lyric poem, even when broken into stanzas, could be considered<br> a single verse paragraph, insofar as it expresses a unified mood or thought; see Gail Mazur’s “Evening.”</p>
